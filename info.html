              Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
              to making science accessible to all. Over the course of human
              history, science has developed from our early understanding of
              fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies
              far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about-h">Our Values</h3>
            <p class="about-us">
              We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
              brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
              different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
              explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
              with and play around to see science come to life.
